# Bomb-It
Description of my project:
The name of my project is "bomb it". This is a game similar to the "bomberman" game.
In the first page of the game, you can choose to mute or unmute the music.
Then,please press "start" button to go to the next page.
The next page is instruction page, it tells you rules to play the game:
-Your character will start at the upper left corner;
-Use "Up" "Down" "Left" or "Right" key to move your character;
-Press the "Space" key to place a bomb;
-The bomb would explode after few seconds with fire around it;
-If you get fired by the explosion, you die;
-Try to kill the three enemies by placing the bomb beside them;
-The character cannot go through a cake, use bomb to clear the cake;
-Also try to avoid getting bombed by the bombs;
-The map is a maze, so you might miss your way.
You can click on "continue" button to the next page.
Now you will get to the page to choose your character.
The player can first start with by choosing from 4 characters to play. 
After the game start, the player will be put in a random generate maze. 
The player will want to kill all of the three AIs as well as avoid being killed by them.
The most challenging parts of my game are the mechanisms of bombs' explosion, maze generation and the AI.
I set three AIs into differnet level of "intellegence". The AI in the lower right corner is the smartest, the one in the upper right corner is the dumbest,
and the one in the lower left corner is the middle. The smart AI can find the nearest path to get to you.
And all of the AIs will place a bomb in order to kill you when you are closed to them.
